# Coding Bootcamp Survival Guide

### This is wisdom for surviving the full time Full Stack Coding Bootcamp offered by UT Austin (and other universities working through Trilogy/2U) as given from a group of students in the Fall 2021 cohort. Take this wisdom for what it is, which is observations from students fresh out of bootcamp. We hope this helps you. 

* If you have time before camp starts, begin doing exercises on FreeCodeCamp. You breeze through HTML and CSS in a very short period of time in bootcamp, so doing that beforehand will help you out. Also, even during bootcamp, getting some practice in on FreeCodeCamp (or whatever your preferred tutorial site might be) can help. The Javascript Algorithms and Data Structures is a good review as you go through the class and after. Sometimes you just need some repetition on things and that is not a bad place to get it. 

* Create a way to save the resources the instructors and TAs put in Slack. That resource will go away at some point. Our cohort created a Discord. Some students put the resources in a Google doc. Bookmark sites and organize them. If you find something that helps you, find a way to save it because it can be hard to find it in the Slack channels again, and it may be gone already. 

* When working on assignments, commit early and often. Fix some code? Commit. Created a new page? Commit. It takes a little getting used to, especially as the early assignments can be really simple. But learn to commit often. 

* Trust the program. You're going to be ready to pull your hair out at times. They run over you with information. The class is a mile wide and an inch deep most of the time. You're not going to understand something, and the instructor moves on to the next section. It'll sink in eventually.  And by the end of class, even if you don't remember what something specific is or does, you will feel like you can code. 

* After week three, when you go into Project 1 week, you'll definitely feel like things are going too fast. Don't freak out. Don't be too hard on yourself. You are exactly where you are supposed to be. It's okay to not know everything yet. You're not ever going to know everything. If you aren't in a full time class, I'm guessing the same applies when you head into your first project.

* Don't compare yourself in the learning process to your classmates. What matters is your willingness to put in the effort and challenge yourself to learn the material. Some things will come easy and others hard, and that applies to most everyone. You'll also figure out later that someone you thought was killing it in class is way behind on assignments. So really, don't compare yourself to everyone because you probably can't see the full picture. 

* Meet on zoom after class. If one or more people in the class (no need for everyone to have a pro version of zoom) are paying for it and sharing a link, get on the zoom. Help explain something from class. Get help on your homework. Help and get help from your classmates. If no one has registered for the pro version of zoom, pay for it. It'll pay for itself ten times over in the help you'll get out of opening up a zoom for your classmates. 

* Ask questions. Lots of questions. Listen to the questions that others are asking. Maybe you didn't understand something, and someone else asked it a different way that makes you understand it. If questions aren't asked, nothing is elaborated on and the instructor just moves on to the next activity. 

* Get a tutor early and meet with them every week. If they aren't helping you, get a new tutor sooner rather than later. They should be guiding you through the homework giving you a path toward finishing it, among other things. You paid for it. Take advantage of it. If you are meeting with your tutor regularly, and getting on zoom at night with classmates, you should be able to get through the homework. 

* Understand the keys to graduating bootcamp. Show up to class. Do the homework. Participate in the projects. It takes a lot of work, but it's doable if you're willing to work. Don't get paralyzed by details. An F is a grade that gets you to graduation. If you don't understand something fully now, you can revisit it after bootcamp. If you go down a rabbit hole and get behind on homework and don't recover, you won't graduate. The certificate doesn't automatically mean you get a job by any means, but it's a lot easier when you've successfully completed the program. If the requirements for completing bootcamp are a little different than mine were, the concept still applies. Don't get hung up on one thing and fail out of bootcamp because of it. Understand the process. Do what it takes to graduate. 

* Everyone hates code quiz. Just get through it. 

* Understand the difference between impostor syndrome and not understanding something. In impostor syndrome, you think you aren't a real coder. You are. As you go through bootcamp, you become more of one. Maybe writing For Loops stumps you, but you still know how to create a page and style it. You know how to write basic functions and assign variables. Not understanding certain aspects of coding doesn't mean you're not a coder. It just means you still have learning to do. 

* You will be told to read the docs. Do that. It's good practice and you may find the answer. But understand that the docs aren't necessarily written by or for junior developers, and they certainly weren't written by English or journalism majors. You may be staring right at the answer and not understand. You may know it's the right answer, but feel like there isn't enough context in the doc for you to know how to use it properly. It'll happen. You just have to keep looking for the site that explains it in a way you understand. And sometimes you just have to try coding it and see what happens. 

* There are so many resources for learning this and explaining that, articles to read, videos on YouTube, other docs, and the class videos, that there isn't enough time in the day to watch/read/process it all. You're going to have to figure out what works for you. And sometimes you'll go back to one you don't normally use and you'll see the answer. If it starts to overwhelm you, take a deep breath. It'll be alright.

* There are going to be days where it's hard to focus, where the instructor talks a lot and you're not processing anything, where the class is on the same wavelength and starts cutting up in the chat. It happens. Pay attention as often as you can, but some days it's really hard. Don't worry about those days too much. Go back and watch the class videos if you need to. Do the activities. If you really needed to know the content from that day, you'll go back and get it. 

* Ask for help. If you are too proud to ask for help when you don't understand something, you're going to get left behind. The people who ask for help are going to get answers. If you suffer in silence, no one can help you. Asking questions means you were smart enough and humble enough to improve yourself and your understanding. Every question you ask will only make you a better coder. 

* In project groups, push to a development branch. Review that as a group. When you agree everything works, then push the development to main. If you do this correctly, then you always have a working app in main. 

* Be careful about code wrapping to a second line in VS Code. Sometimes it works fine, especially if inside a curly bracket and with commas or semi-colons on each line. But if a line of code gets long and wraps to the next line so you can see it, and your code doesn't work, try putting it all on one line. That may be your problem. See how the code works locally by moving the code from two lines to one and back again. The code may be 100% correct but not work( somewhat properly or at all) if wrapped to a second line.  

* When your deploy fails, read the log carefully. Especially at your level, check for capitalization and spelling inconsistencies before you start breaking your code. Then check the log and look at the referenced code for things like unused variables, missing punctuation, or something missing in your package.json file. If the app worked locally, chances are it's just a small inconsistency somewhere that VS Code overlooked but Heroku or Netlify didn't like. Trust your code and read the logs to see exactly where the issue is. 

* If career services is offered with your bootcamp, take a look at the milestones before graduation, assuming you're not completely overwhelmed. When you actually look at them, they aren't too bad. Submit them early so you can start the process of job hunting with career services sooner rather than later. 

* Everyone hated code quiz. Except apparently Damien and Mat. Freaks.
